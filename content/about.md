I'm Andrea! I'm a technology enthusiast, born and raised in Turin, Italy :it:.\
As of 2019, I live in Zürich, Switzerland, where I graduated from a master in Electrical Engineering and IT at ETH Zurich in 2021.

Ever since I was a youngling, I've been fascinated by the idea of creating. There is something special in shaping the world that surrounds us, which I now believe is one of the many definitions of humanity.

In the later years of my childhood, I discovered the fascination for computers, coding, and in general all sort of light-blinking electronic devices (denigrators will say that I share some genes with bugs, whose effect can be often seen in my code production), but it wasn't until high school that I came in touch with electronics and discovered that I could finally blink LEDs as I wanted.

Those years set me off on the path I am now, during which I could learn a lot over a wide span of topics. I am currently focusing on deploying *Sensors and Machine Learning on the Edge*, but I get also excited about *Cyber Security*, *Hardware*, and *Networking* in their various forms. Nevertheless, I still remember to blink some lights from time to time, just to honor the humble beginning of my journey.

I love hiking, especially in the mountains (thanks Switzerland), and I am starting to enjoy some climbing as well.
I also try to occasionally dedicate some time to watch a quality movie or read a good book (I have a soft spot for fantasy).

Oh, “why the website?” you might wonder. It actually happens that the very first “coding” skill I learnt was web development (I still have PHP nightmares), and when I found myself in need of some personal cyber-space and with some free time to invest, I decided to go for a website as a tribute to my younger self.

In case you want to discuss anything, give a suggestion, or complain about the new Star Wars trilogy :wink:, feel free to drop me an e-mail at *andr.ronco@gmail.com*

*Va fail*,\
Andrea
