I'm Andrea! I'm a technology enthusiast, born and raised in Italy :it:.\
As of 2019, I live in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland, and I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering at ETH.

I love hiking, climbing, and watching quality movies, usually not all at once  (but you never know).\
Time permitting, I also enjoy reading a good book (I have a soft spot for fantasy) along with a warm cup of tea.

I've always been attracted by electronic devices and blinking lights (slanderers will say that I share some blood with *bugs*, which could explain a thing or two in my code), and I felt so blessed when in high school I discovered that I could blink LEDs as *I* wanted. I did learn a thing or two on the path, and I recently started working on Machine Learning on the Edge, sensors, and no-light-involving projects. Nevertheless, I still blink some LEDs from time to time.

Oh, "*why the website?*" you might wonder. It actually happens that the very first "coding-oriented" skill that I learnt was web-development (I still have PHP nightmares), and when I found myself in need of some personal cyber-space, I decided to go for a website as a tribute to my younger self.

In case you want to discuss something, have a chat, or complain about the new *Star Wars* trilogy :wink:, feel free to drop me an e-mail at *andr.ronco@gmail.com*

*Va fail*,\
Andrea
