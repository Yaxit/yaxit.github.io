## Work Experience and Team Projects
{{< cv-entry-3 "**Team PoliTOcean**" "*Member*" "**2018-2019**" >}}\
I’ve been member of a student team at Polytechnic of Turin in the Electronic area. Together
with my team we designed a rover to be presented at the MATE International ROV
Competition in the US.

\
{{< cv-entry-3 "**Microtecnica S.r.l.**" "*Summer Intern*" "**2015**" >}}\
Summer internship in the Engineering Area. I analysed data from public databases to
evaluate MTBF of some aircraft components to improve reliability.

## Selected Projects

{{< cv-entry-3 "**Optical Flow for Drones on PULP**" "*Semester Thesis*" "**2020**" >}}\
During the Thesis, I ported the driver for an Optical Flow Sensor (PMW3901, PixArt) from the STM32 to a PULP chip.
The sensor aids the stabilization of a Crazyflie drone and will be used in future projects for a PULP-based nano-UAV.

\
{{< cv-entry-3 "**Federated Learning on PULP**" "*Course Project*" "**2020**" >}}\
A two-students team project where we developed a Convolutional Neural Network for computer vision tasks on a multicore PULP chip.
The challenge was developing the full network from scratch in C and to parallelize the the computation on the 8-core platform
We developed the full network from scratch in C, and parallelized the computation to speed up the training time, showing the feasibility of federated learning withing a reduced power-envelop.

\
{{< cv-entry-3 "**Deep Convolutional Networks on STM32**" "*Course Project*" "**2020**" >}}\
I developed and evaluated different techniques to port a Keras neural network on the STM32, focusing on the efficiency tradeoff between floating-point implementation and quantized networks for memory and power critical settings.
